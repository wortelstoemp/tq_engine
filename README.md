# TQ Engine

Rendering engine by Tom Quareme in ANSI C99. 
For simulation, games and other real-time stuff...
Currently focused on rendering in particular (software / hardware).

## Build

Currently there is only a build script for cl.exe on Windows.
This will later on be extended to Linux (GCC/Clang) once the platform layer is done.

- Make sure Visual Studio is installed.
- Navigate to ..\make
- Execute shell.bat to load all environment variables for Visual Studio and cl.exe into your current shell.
- Execute build.bat to build
- Execute run.bat to run
- Execute debug.bat to debug

## Controls
Currently not supported
